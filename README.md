## 📖 Key Topics Covered

### 1. Classes and Objects
```cpp
class Book {
private:
    string title;    // Encapsulation
public:
    Book(string t) : title(t) {}  // Constructor
    string getTitle() const { return title; }  // Getter
};
```

### 2. File Operations
```cpp
// Writing to file
ofstream file("data.txt");
file << book.toString() << "\n";

// Reading from file
ifstream file("data.txt");
getline(file, line);
book.fromString(line);
```

### 3. Memory Management
```cpp
// Stack allocation
Book book("Title", "Author");

// Dynamic allocation
Book* bookPtr = new Book("Title", "Author");
delete bookPtr;  // Don't forget to free memory!

// Smart pointers (modern C++)
unique_ptr<Book> smartBook = make_unique<Book>("Title", "Author");
```

### 4. Error Handling
```cpp
if (!file.is_open()) {
    cout << "Error: Cannot open file!\n";
    return false;
}
```

## 🔧 Compilation Tips

### Basic Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra filename.cpp -o output
```

### With Debugging
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -g filename.cpp -o output
gdb ./output
```

### Optimization
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 filename.cpp -o output
```

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Compilation Errors
- **Missing includes**: Make sure to include necessary headers
- **Namespace issues**: Use `std::` prefix or `using namespace std;`
- **Linking errors**: Ensure all functions are properly defined

### 2. Runtime Errors
- **Segmentation fault**: Check for null pointers and array bounds
- **File not found**: Verify file paths and permissions
- **Memory leaks**: Use smart pointers or ensure proper cleanup

### 3. Logic Errors
- **Infinite loops**: Check loop conditions carefully
- **Wrong output**: Use debugging prints to trace execution
- **Data corruption**: Validate input and handle edge cases
